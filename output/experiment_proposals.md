# A/B Test & Experiment Proposals

Based on the cluster analysis, here are specific, data-driven experiments we should run to improve key metrics.

---

### Experiment 1: The 'VIP Treatment' for High-Value Regulars

- **Target Cluster**: 0 (The High-Value Regulars)
- **Hypothesis**: Proactively offering exclusive content or a 'first look' to our top fans will increase their monthly spend and improve retention.
- **A/B Test Setup**:
  - **Group A (Control)**: Continue with the current engagement strategy.
  - **Group B (Test)**: For a random 50% of fans in this cluster, have chatters send one unsolicited 'exclusive' photo or message per week with a note like, 'You're one of my favorite fans, so I wanted you to see this first!'
- **Key Metrics to Track**: 
  - `avg_revenue_per_fan` (Expect a 15%+ increase in Group B)
  - `churn_rate` (Expect a 20%+ decrease in Group B)
- **Duration**: 4 weeks.

### Experiment 2: The 'Gentle Nudge' for Friendly Chatters

- **Target Cluster**: 2 (The Friendly Chatters)
- **Hypothesis**: We can convert rapport into revenue by introducing a low-priced, personalized offer during a positive conversation.
- **A/B Test Setup**:
  - **Group A (Control)**: Continue with the current engagement strategy.
  - **Group B (Test)**: Train chatters to identify a peak moment of friendly conversation. At that point, they should say, 'You're so fun to talk to! For just $5, I can send you a special set of photos I don't share with everyone.'
- **Key Metrics to Track**: 
  - `purchase_conversion_rate` (Expect a 25%+ increase in Group B)
  - `avg_purchases_per_fan`
- **Duration**: 2 weeks.

### Experiment 3: The 'Content Menu' for Direct Fans

- **Target Cluster**: 1 (The Direct & Explicit Fans)
- **Hypothesis**: Providing a clear menu of content options and prices to direct fans will lead to faster purchases and higher average transaction values.
- **A/B Test Setup**:
  - **Group A (Control)**: Continue with the current reactive conversation style.
  - **Group B (Test)**: After the fan's initial explicit request, the chatter responds with, 'Absolutely! I have a few options for that. A 5-photo set is $15, a 1-minute video is $25. Which would you prefer?'
- **Key Metrics to Track**: 
  - `time_to_first_purchase` (Expect a 40%+ decrease in Group B)
  - `avg_price_per_purchase` (Expect a 10%+ increase in Group B)
- **Duration**: 3 weeks.
