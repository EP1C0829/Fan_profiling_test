# AI OnlyFans Analytics Developer - Technical Assessment (Phase 2)

## Congratulations on Completing Phase 1!

Based on your Phase 1 submission, we're providing you with our full dataset to demonstrate your approach at scale.

## Phase 2 Data

- **File**: `sample_chatlogs.pkl` (884K messages, 10K fans, 50 days)
- **Note**: 32% of fans talk to multiple models
- **Size**: 568MB - this is real production-scale data

## Phase 2 Expectations

With the full dataset:
1. **Validate your approach** - Does it scale as you predicted?
2. **Find real patterns** - Meaningful clusters should emerge
3. **Refine insights** - More data reveals more nuance
4. **Performance test** - Ensure reasonable runtime

## What to Submit

1. **Updated code** - Handling the larger dataset
2. **New results** - Clusters, profiles, insights from full data
3. **Comparison** - How do Phase 2 results differ from Phase 1?
4. **Scaling notes** - What broke? What needed optimization?

## Evaluation Focus

- Did your Phase 1 approach work at scale?
- Are the insights more actionable with more data?
- How did you handle the 100x data increase?
- What new patterns emerged?

## Timeline

You have 3 additional days to:
